# Typing tool

A typing tool that measures your speed, accuracy and few more additional stats. This project is created to get comfortable with Python as a side project.

## Overview

Currently this version only handles characters passed to the engine(evaluates counters for total chars, correct chars etc.)
TUI is in initial stage and not complete.
The engine is also very simple.

## Installation

This is completely not avavilable for real world uses yet. But you can still clone the repo to test it yourself or use the codebase as a foundation of your new projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedowM/typr.git

cd typr
python tui.py

```

## Dependencies

```text
rich
textual
```

---

Install with:

```bash
pip install rich textual
```

## Future

The TUI will be complete sooner or later. After completing it, I am planning to add more features like statistics, custom time limits, custom theme support, huge text database to choose from, and also custom text file support.
